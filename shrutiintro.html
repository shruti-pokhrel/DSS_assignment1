    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    <br><br>
    <img src=file:///E:/shruti/IMG_20180716_153901.jpg height="80" width="100"class="rotateimg180">
    <p>My name is Shruti Pokhrel and am currently a 11th standard student studying at Sifal Secondary School. I graduated from Alpine Academy with decent grades.
         I was born and raised in Kathmandu in a nuclear family of five. I’ve two siblings-a brother and a sister.<br>
         Since my early childhood, I was always taught to be a principled person. To be honest, it’s difficult for me to make friends but once I
          make friends, it’s great and people find me different. I define myself as an introvert who don’t like to open up in front of people easily.
        I am sympathetic to the feeling of others, as well as sensitive of other people’s perception of me. This sensitivity to other’s opinions 
        makes me more self-conscious of myself. However, my siblings have always been my best friends. I always have a great time with them. They 
        have always taught and reminded me that everything happens for a reason and one should always find the best way to cope with it. Cooking 
         has always been my passion. I think cooking is the best way of adding some flavors to one’s life. Moreover, my hobbies include photography,
        learning languages and listening to poetry.<br>
        Right now I’m just focusing on my studies and getting prepared for the ups and downs I might have to face in the days to come. 
        But my ultimate aim is to be a self- reliant and remain an optimistic girl.<br><br>
